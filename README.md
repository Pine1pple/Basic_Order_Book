The order book maintains a list of buy and sell orders for a particular financial instrument. Each order includes details such as order type (market, limit, stop), direction (buy or sell), price, and quantity.

Users can place buy or sell orders by specifying the order type, direction, price (optional for market orders), and quantity.

Existing orders can be canceled by specifying the order type, direction, and price (if applicable).

Orders can be modified by changing the price and quantity.

Orders are automatically matched based on their type and price. For example, a buy order is matched with the lowest available sell order if the price matches or exceeds the buy price.

Users can view the current state of the order book, including all active buy and sell orders along with their prices and quantities.
